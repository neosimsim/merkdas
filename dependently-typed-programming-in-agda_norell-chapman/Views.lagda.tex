\begin{code}
module Views where
\end{code}

Views are data types which whole purpose is to tell something
interesting about it's indices.

Here is a view data type for even and odd numbers.
\begin{code}
open import Data.Nat
open import Function
open import Data.List
open import Data.Bool

data Parity : ℕ → Set where
  even : (k : ℕ) → Parity (k * 2)
  odd  : (k : ℕ) → Parity (1 + k * 2)
\end{code}

The view type on it's own is not really useful.
We need a function that lifts the index type of the
view type into the view type:
\begin{code}
parity : ∀ n → Parity n
parity zero = even zero
parity (suc n) with parity n
parity (suc .(k * 2)) | even k = odd k
parity (suc .(1 + k * 2)) | odd k = even (suc k)
\end{code}

\begin{code}
half : ℕ → ℕ
half n with parity n
half .(k * 2)     | even k = k
half .(1 + k * 2) | odd k  = k
\end{code}

\begin{code}
infixr 30 _:all:_
data All {A : Set}(P : A → Set) : List A → Set where
  all[] : All P []
  _:all:_ : ∀ {x xs} → P x → P x → All P xs → All P (x ∷ xs)
\end{code}

“Turn a decidable predicate into a generat predicate.”
\begin{code}
satisfies : {A : Set} → (A → Bool) → A → Set
satisfies p x = T (p x)
\end{code}
