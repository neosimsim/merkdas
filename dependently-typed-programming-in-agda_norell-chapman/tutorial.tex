% DejaVu Sans is a font which supports the most Unicode symbols used by Agda. Unfortunately it is
% no monospaces font. However some symbols, e. g. ⦃ are not supported by any monospaced font I
% checked. Even when using a fallback font (like emacs does), ⦃ is not display with a fixed width.
% Therefore Agda code cannot be aligned with spaces as we programmers are used to. Aligning
% code is the only reason, I can think of, to use monospaces fonts. In conjunctions this means
% It's not a big deal to use a variable width font for Agda code blocks.
